<h2>About</h2>
University Degree's and Collage Diploma can't provide proof that I know UI design (its just a piece of paper). This repository does. The purpose of this repository is to act as proof-of-understanding to prospective employers. It allows you (as an employer/hiring manager) to interact with my work rather than banking on the marks and test scores I recieved in school. 

<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>
Familiarise myself with the basics of WPF and MVVM mode, allowing me to make my own software/utilities for my day-to-day life, and work related tasks.

<h2>Key learnings</h2>

- UI Layout using XAML
